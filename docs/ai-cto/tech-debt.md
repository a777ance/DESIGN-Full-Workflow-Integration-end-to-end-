# Tech Debt

Tracked items across all repos. P1 = blocks Phase 1 shipping. P2 = important but not blocking. P3 = nice-to-fix.

Update this file when items are resolved or new ones are found. New items go at the top
(newest first, per house style); IDs stay fixed.

| ID | Item | Severity | Repo | Status |
| -- | ---- | -------- | ---- | ------ |
| TD-16 | Claude Code spend not routed by task: every session (incl. the daily NARF state-check) runs Opus 4.8, with multi-file reads pulled into the main context. Cheap diff-checks should run on Haiku/Sonnet tier and/or via an Explore subagent that returns only a summary; reserve Opus for synthesis. Our own `config.yaml` ladder philosophy ("route, don't waste") is not applied to our biggest AI spend. Industry routing saving: 60–80%. See `reviews/2026-06-27-review-1.md`. | P2 | DESIGN (process) | Open (found 2026-06-27) |
| TD-15 | `CLAUDE.md` bloat = always-on token cost: `localDNS`/`DESIGN` briefings are ~250–300 lines and the ~28-line House-style block is duplicated verbatim across all 7 repos, so it loads in full every session. Best practice is <200 lines; move runbook tables/checklists (localDNS §F, most of §C/§D) into linked on-demand docs and dedupe House-style into one `STYLE.md`. Improves instruction-following too. See `reviews/2026-06-27-review-1.md`. | P2 | all repos (process) | Open (found 2026-06-27) |
| TD-14 | LLM-router privacy fallback gap: a `sensitive`-tagged task routes to `local-reason`, but `config.yaml` gives `local-reason` a `["cloud-gpu-reason", "cloud-overflow"]` fallback — so a sensitive prompt can fail over to `cloud-overflow` (Claude cloud) if the local model is down. The dispatcher's `allow_cloud=False` is not enforced at the LiteLLM failover layer, and its own docstring requires a local-only chain here. Fix: give `local-reason` a local-only fallback (fail closed). No privacy guarantee until then. | P1 | localDNS | Open (found 2026-06-07) |
| TD-13 | Statement PWA: merged but not deployed or tested on real mobile devices | P1 | localDNS | Open |
| TD-12 | WireGuard IPv6 black hole: peers routing ::/0 black-hole IPv6 traffic | P3 | localDNS | Documented; ULA+NAT66 fix in network-context.md |
| TD-11 | `tools/check-docs.py` is not wired into CI — manual only | P2 | DESIGN | Resolved (2026-06-05) — `.github/workflows/check-docs.yml` runs it on push/PR to `main` |
| TD-10 | azure-lab is an empty stub — no scope, no CLAUDE.md, no infrastructure | P3 | azure-lab | Deferred until scope defined |
| TD-09 | Member dues amount is CHANGE_ME — open business decision, not a code issue | P1 | MARKETING | Open decision |
| TD-08 | Per-category gigabyte breakdown: nftables measuring layer scaffolded but not running | P2 | localDNS | Blocked on TD-03 |
| TD-07 | "How You Compare" neighbor benchmark is placeholder — no real cohort data | P2 | localDNS | Blocked on cohort dataset |
| TD-06 | Stage 11 automations not wired — all cross-stage transitions require manual data re-entry | P1 | DESIGN | Open |
| TD-05 | Pi-hole live upstreams may differ from repo after volume migration — verify after next deploy | P2 | localDNS | Verify on deploy |
| TD-04 | `FTLCONF_webserver_api_password` is `CHANGE_ME` — deliberate placeholder, must stay out of git | P1 | localDNS | Intentional; use .env |
| TD-03 | nftables volume populator scaffolded in repo but not deployed to t630 | P1 | localDNS | Open |
| TD-02 | Windows laptop WireGuard key was exposed during setup — rotate before trusting this peer | P2 | localDNS | Open |
| TD-01 | WireGuard peers 10.8.0.4–6 have real public keys but no recent handshake — identify or remove | P2 | localDNS | Open |
