# CLAUDE.md

The short briefing — read this first. [README.md](README.md) is the full stage-by-stage guide;
[workflow-context.md](workflow-context.md) explains the *why* behind the non-obvious calls.

This repo is the **business machine around the Statements.** The product is the monthly
Statement (see [Section E](#e-the-statements--the-center)); everything here exists to get a
household to its first one, keep producing and delivering it, get paid for it, and turn some
recipients into the operators who produce the next ones. The Statements themselves — the gold
standard — live in the public **[`localDNS`](https://a777ance.github.io/localDNS/)** repo under
`docs/statements/`.

**The voice rule for this whole repo:** write it the way a good salesperson talks to a
homeowner, not the way an IT person talks to a server. Concrete, named, plain. "Your
living-room TV," not "the endpoint." When in doubt, read a real "Handled For You" log and match
it. The plain-English swap table is in
[`00-brand-identity/the-pitch.md`](00-brand-identity/the-pitch.md).

## House style: ordering & typography

These conventions apply across **every** A777ance repo — current and future. (Adopted 2026-06-05.)

- **Time-based content reads newest-first (reverse-chronological).** Logs, changelogs,
  decision logs (ADR / FIN), known-issues and issue trackers, FAQs, metrics and review
  logs, and "Handled For You" entries all lead with the most recent item. Apply this
  within the time-based *section* even when the whole file isn't time-based.
- **Alphabetical lists run Z → A** (descending).
- **Walkthroughs: reverse the blocks, keep the steps.** In a step-by-step guide, present
  the major sections/blocks in reverse order (last block first — it helps "block" the
  work), but keep the numbered steps *within* each block in forward order so every
  procedure stays followable. A walkthrough's table of contents mirrors the reversed
  block order. **Never renumber** — step and stage numbers stay fixed, so the intended
  execution order is always readable from the numbers.
- **Font: Gill Sans MT everywhere.** Every surface — customer-facing or internal — uses
  Gill Sans MT. Web/CSS stack:
  `'Gill Sans MT', 'Gill Sans', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif`.

## Bifrost — active command schema (loads every session)

<!-- bifrost-briefing:start — GENERATED from localDNS/04-user-services/ai-orchestration/briefing-block.md by tools/sync-briefings.py. Do not hand-edit; edit the canonical file and re-run. -->

**Bifrost** is the A777ance command-composition schema — a keyboard-spatial notation
(`~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ()` swept left→right, each glyph an *archetype* fulfilled by slash
commands + a plain-language sub-prompt). It is **active from the first token of every
session, in every repo:** adopt the `~` lazy-anchor posture — fire the first token ASAP
(the *model* stays high), let continuity coalesce mid-flight — and read Bifrost notation
per the schema whenever used.

- **Backbone:** `'` ignition (begins the Bifrost) · `~` continuity/lazy-anchor · `` ` ``
  descriptor (and, bare, the *expansion call*) · `!` cargo (a *manifest* — not executed on
  loading) · `@` source — **read-only** · `#` repo/destination — **write-allowed** · `$` sanity ·
  `%` compliance · `^` cars/lanes · `&` rotary — the **rabbit trail**, a nested Bifrost (also
  the sequential form) · `*` stop signal (red by default) · `()` governance (release
  conditions). Off-row `'`/`~`/`` ` `` stage; keys 1–4 **Preload** form a complete manifest —
  *what · from where · to where · against what*.
- **`@`/`#` are a permission pair, not a pair of arrows** (founder's rule, 2026-08-08). `@` is
  **read-only** — read it, never write it. `#` is **write-allowed** — what this run may create,
  modify or overwrite (still two-way). **They may overlap:** `@` alone = read-only, `#` alone =
  writable, both = read-write. Two slots, three states, one **mount table**. `@` still reads and
  `#` still writes, so every string already written stays valid — this only *adds* the guardrail,
  and gives the one-way door a question with an answer: *is every write inside `#`?*
- **`'` is always the signal to begin the Bifrost** (founder's rule, 2026-08-07 — fixes a
  mobile bug). Treat `'`, `’` (curly) and `′` as one glyph, and treat **presence and
  absence as the same string**: `' ~ !…` ≡ `~ !…`, `''` ≡ `'`. It marks *where* the Bifrost
  starts, never *what* runs — no sub-prompt, no `/how`, no intensity dial, `0` turbulence. A
  letter-flanked `'` (`don't`, `founder's`) is prose in a sub-prompt, not an ignition; only a
  free-standing `'` ignites. Never ask which apostrophe the phone chose.
- **A bare `'` (the whole message) = the reference call. Return this string and NOTHING else:**

  ```text
  ~!@#$%^&*()
  ```

  It is **the sweep itself** — exactly what sliding a finger down the row on a laptop puts on
  the screen. Not a legend, not a glossary, not a table: the row. So it is a **lookup, not a
  generation** — same bytes every call, every session, every model. No preamble, no trailing
  offer, no adaptation to the conversation. Answer *immediately*; it reads no file and fires no
  cargo. Glyph *meanings* live in the backbone above; the reference call hands back the
  **order**, which is the thing a phone cannot sweep for itself.
- **A bare descriptor — `` `…` `` with no backbone glyph in the message — is the *expansion
  call*.** The backticked text is a **seed**, and the answer is one complete, schema-compliant
  line with **every backbone slot filled in**, for the founder to read, parse and tweak:

  ```text
  ~ (fill in) ! (fill in) @ (fill in) # (fill in) $ (fill in) % (fill in) ^ (fill in) & (fill in) * (fill in) ( (fill in) )
  ```

  **The skeleton is the sweep, spaced** — strike the `(fill in)` slots and the whitespace and
  `~!@#$%^&*()` remains. `'` hands back the **order**; `` `seed` `` hands back the order **with
  the slots filled**. Echo the seed back on the `` ` `` line; fill **every** slot, never drop one
  (a complete draft is edited *down*); emit in Golden Rule order, so `K = 0` by construction;
  **`*` comes back RED, always** — an expansion is a *proposal*, nothing ran and no `#` was
  touched; and **collapse it** — where the surface renders HTML, ship it inside a `<details>`
  whose `<summary>` is the `~` requirement line. With a backbone glyph present, `` ` `` is the
  ordinary descriptor, unchanged. An empty descriptor returns the sweep. Unlike the bare `'`
  (a constant), an expansion **generates** — so the selector matters, and here it is the
  **human at the `*` gate**, not a vote.
- **`` ` `` and `&` are the same operation — nesting, at two positions** (founder's rule,
  2026-08-08). `&` is the **rabbit trail**: a digression you *come back from*, opening another
  full Bifrost inside this one. `` ` `` nests at staging, `&` nests on the road —
  `` `seed` `` ≡ `& seed` hoisted to position zero, which is why a bare descriptor can generate
  a line at all. So **expansion is recursive by construction**, and `&`'s "sequential" reading
  is just nesting seen from the parent's frame.
- **The greater traffic light is always the last bulwark** (founder's rule, 2026-08-08). Every
  nest **adds** a light; none removes one. An inner `*` going green releases its chunk **into
  its parent**, never into the world — only the outermost `*` stands between a `!` and an
  effect that cannot be recalled, however many inner gates already cleared. **Permissions
  intersect inward, gates conjoin outward:** a nested road may never write outside its parent's
  `#`, nor release past its parent's `*`. That is what lets `~` stay reckless at any depth —
  nesting multiplies the reasoning, never the exposure.
- **`*` cuts the road into Dispensations** — bounded, self-governing chunks. Governance has
  three outcomes: satisfied → green · **re-flagged** → return upstream via `&` (this is what
  lets a fixed string produce unbounded output) · unsatisfiable → eject to the shoulder.
- **The one-way door:** `~` rushes the reasoning, `*` gates the *effects* — anything
  irreversible (publish, deploy, send, push) rides past a light, which is exactly what makes
  the lazy start affordable.
- **Cars:** explicit `^` beats inferred. With no `^`, `!`'s command arity instantiates lanes
  1:1; with `^` present, `^` sets the lanes and `!`'s commands are the per-lane pipeline.
- **Guardrails survive a keyboard-mash:** `~` continuity, `$` sanity, `%` compliance — plus
  `*()` **governance**, the only one that repeats at every chunk boundary. `+` / repetition =
  more; `-` inverts into a stress test.

## 0. What this repo is

The end-to-end playbook for the A777ance guild: how a stranger becomes a **customer** (a
household getting a monthly Statement), and how a customer becomes an **operator** (a guild
member running Statements for a block of homes). Every folder is a stage of that journey, and
maps to the live tool where the work actually happens (see the [stage map](#c-stage-map)). What
you edit here are the specs, scripts, templates, and the map — they go live when you put them
into the real tool.

**Three repos, one business:**

| Repo | Holds | Visibility |
| ---- | ----- | ---------- |
| **[`localDNS`](https://a777ance.github.io/localDNS/)** | The tech **and** the Statements (`docs/statements/`) — the product | **Public** |
| **`MARKETING`** | The business model, pricing, guild mechanics — the *why* | **Private** |
| **`DESIGN-…` (this repo)** | The workflow around the Statements — the *how* | **Private / internal** |

**This repo is internal.** The customer-facing stuff (brand, website, the Statements) is
published *from here into* public places; the workflow itself — the customer list, the money,
the recruiting economics — is not. Never commit real passwords or personal info: use
`CHANGE_ME` placeholders and keep secrets in `.env` (git-ignored). The sample data here is made
up.

## A. The funnel at a glance

```
STRANGER  (a household that doesn't know it has a problem)
   │   02 demand gen — "pest control for your internet" · local search · ads · email
   ▼
LEAD ─────► 03 booking form → pick a time → the free look
   │   04 phone — a real person answers and confirms the visit
   ▼
CUSTOMER ─► 05 sales — consult · quote · $175 setup · YES
   │            └──► set up the box ───────────────►  localDNS
   │   07 payments — $175 setup + $35/month
   ▼
══════════ THE PRODUCT — what they pay for, every month ════════════════════════
   06  THE STATEMENT  ◄── the gold standard · localDNS/docs/statements
       • the homeowner's Network Activity Statement — the "sticker on the door"
       • the operator's portfolio — one view of their whole book
   sent by email · mailed on paper · scrollable from a QR code
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   │   the statement raises a hand:  "Connect in the Alliance"
   ▼
SOME CUSTOMERS ─► 09 recruiting — happy customer → vetted operator
   │   10 compliance — W-9 · 1099 · the agreement (they're contractors)
   ▼
OPERATOR  (now runs statements for a block of homes) ──┐
                                                       └─► back to 06, at scale

   00 brand underlies all of it  ·  01 web is the storefront
   08 the master list is what every stage reads & writes
   11 the glue moves a customer from one stage to the next, untouched by hand
```

## B. Roles & money flow

A **two-sided guild** (full version in `MARKETING`). Both sides pay the platform; the service
money flows customer→operator directly, like hiring a tradesperson through a guild.

```
Customer ──platform membership──▶ A777ance ◀──member dues── Operator
   │                                                            ▲
   └──────────────── pays directly for the service ────────────┘
```

| Role | Pays | Earns | This repo's job for them |
| ---- | ---- | ----- | ------------------------ |
| **Customer** (household) | Membership + their operator | — | Stages 02→07: find, sell, bill, deliver |
| **Operator** (e.g. Jose) | Member dues | Bills customers directly | Stages 09→10: recruit, vet, onboard, pay as a 1099 |
| **Platform** (A777ance) | — | Both subscriptions | Stages 00, 01, 08, 11: brand, storefront, the list, the glue |

**The incentive that keeps it honest:** the operator is on a flat monthly, so **every problem
is a cost, not a payday.** Operator and customer both want a boring, unbreakable network — so
make the network *dull* and the *proof of quiet* vivid. The Statement is that proof.

## C. Stage map

Folders are numbered by **funnel order** — the path a household travels. A folder's number is
where it sits in the journey, not how important it is. This maps each folder → the live tool
where the work happens → what makes a change go live.

| Folder | Lives in (the live tool) | Go live |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ------- |
| `00-brand-identity/` | Figma + the asset folder | Export assets; update the brand-kit links everything inherits |
| `01-web-presence/` | Squarespace · the blog · Google Business · the statement gallery (from `localDNS`) | Publish the site; verify the Google listing |
| `02-demand-generation/` | Google/Meta ads · local search · Mailchimp | Launch a campaign on one block's ZIPs; sync the email list |
| `03-funnels-and-capture/` | Landing pages + the booking form + Setmore | Publish the funnel; wire the form → the list (08) via the glue (11) |
| `04-phone-and-comms/` | A business line (Google Voice / OpenPhone) | Set hours, greeting, routing; jot every call onto the list |
| `05-sales-and-onboarding/` | The list + a proposal/e-sign tool → hand-off to set up the box | Send the quote; on "yes," set up the box and collect the setup fee |
| `06-statements-delivery/` | `localDNS`'s statement tool + email + print/mail + QR | Run the monthly job; send the statements; QR codes go live |
| `07-payments-receivables/` | Stripe + bookkeeping | Set up the plan; collect setup + monthly; keep the books straight |
| `08-client-list-and-crm/` | A CRM / Airtable — **the master list** | Keep it current; it feeds the statement tool and every stage |
| `09-recruiting-and-guild/` | An application page + vetting + Setmore | Open applications; run vetting; onboard operators |
| `10-gig-workers-compliance/` | A 1099 / payroll tool (Gusto / Track1099) + e-sign | Collect W-9s; pay operators; file 1099-NECs by Jan 31 |
| `11-automations/` | Zapier / Make + the `localDNS` statement job | Switch on the automations that carry a customer stage→stage |

Each folder's own README is the spec for that stage; the scripts, templates, and checklists sit
beside it.

## D. The one master list

`08-client-list-and-crm/` is the single source of truth. **One entry per household, one per
operator, one per route** (a route = a cluster of nearby homes). Every other stage reads and
writes that same entry:

```
02 demand gen ─writes─► a lead          08 reads it to plan the next campaign
03 booking    ─writes─► lead + booking   05 reads it to run a warm consult
05 sales      ─writes─► customer          06 reads it to build statements
07 payments   ─writes─► paid / not paid   06 reads it to skip the unpaid
09 recruiting ─writes─► operator           10 reads it to file the 1099
```

The full field list is in [`08-client-list-and-crm/schema.md`](08-client-list-and-crm/schema.md).
**The rule:** a fact is either in that list or it doesn't exist — no stray spreadsheet columns,
no operator's private "my homes" tab. If a stage needs a new fact, add it to the list first.

## E. The Statements — the center

Everything in this repo surrounds two artifacts, and **this repo does not own them** — it builds
the business that delivers them. They are the gold standard, built and published in `localDNS`:

| Statement | Who it's for | What it is | Where it lives |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------- | -------------- |
| **Network Activity Statement** | The homeowner | A one-page monthly proof — the "sticker on the door" that shows the quiet was earned | `localDNS/docs/statements/client/*.html` |
| **Alliance Member Portfolio** | The operator | One view across a whole book of homes — totals, the to-do list, the work log | `localDNS/docs/statements/operator/*.html` |

The model is **pest control, not lawn care:** the value is the quiet, and the Statement makes
the invisible work visible. Both are built by a tool that reads the customer's data file at
about a penny a home. **This repo's only job around them** is the surround: fill the funnel that
earns the first one (00–05), bill for it (07), deliver it on schedule (06), and turn its
"Connect in the Alliance" tap into the next operator (09–10).

**The honesty rule:** never print a number the data doesn't support. `localDNS` tracks which
figures are real today (how many lookups, how much got blocked, uptime) versus not-built-yet (a
by-category gigabyte breakdown; how a home compares to its neighbors). Stages 06 and 08 inherit
that discipline: a Statement goes out for money only with numbers the box actually measured.

## 1. Known issues & open decisions

| Issue | What to do |
| ----- | ---------- |
| Don't build the app to fake liquidity | The customer/operator toggle app is **tech, not moat** — don't build it to manufacture demand. Phase gates live in `MARKETING`. |
| Secrets & personal info | Every key, password, and real record is a `CHANGE_ME`/`.env` placeholder here. Don't commit the real thing. |
| Contractor vs. employee | `10-gig-workers-compliance/` documents the 1099 path; confirm the classification with a lawyer before scaling — misclassification is the real risk. |
| The vetting standard | "Guild-certified" isn't defined concretely yet — `09-recruiting-and-guild/vetting-checklist.md` is a first draft, not a legal standard. |
| Pricing | $175 setup + $35/mo — **market-validated band $29–39/mo** (ADR-007 / `MARKETING`); setup never discounted; founding cohort (first ~5) gets **$29/mo locked 12mo**, not a setup cut. *Validation* = first cohort renews at price. |
| Member dues amount + what they include | Working ballpark ~$50/mo flat (a price test, not final); what it *unlocks* is still open in `MARKETING`. |
| A by-category gigabyte breakdown | The measuring layer is scaffolded in `localDNS`, not stood up yet — keep statements to the figures we *do* measure until it's real. |
| The "How You Compare" neighbor data | Still a placeholder — don't print made-up neighbor averages on a document people keep. Carried from `localDNS`/`MARKETING`. |

## 2. Verification

The funnel is "live end to end" when a made-up household can travel every stage without anyone
retyping data by hand. Walk it:

```
1.  An ad / a search result lands on the website                          (02 → 01)
2.  The booking form creates a lead on the master list                     (03 → 08)
3.  Setmore books the consult and the call gets written up                 (03, 04 → 08)
4.  The quote sends, they e-sign, lead flips to customer                    (05 → 08)
5.  The setup fee + monthly plan are created and the first charge clears    (07)
6.  The box gets set up                                                    (05 → localDNS)
7.  A statement is built from the data file and is emailed + mailed         (06 → localDNS)
8.  A "Connect in the Alliance" tap creates an operator lead                (06 → 09)
9.  A W-9 is collected and the agreement is signed                          (10)
10. Every step above was carried by an automation, not a copy-paste         (11)
```

If any arrow needs a human to retype data from one tool into another, that seam is a **bug in
stage 11**, not a feature. Spot-check: open the record for the worked-example household
(the sample household, HH-0001) and confirm it carries facts written by stages 02, 03, 05, and 07.

**Doc integrity:** `python3 tools/check-docs.py` confirms every internal link and cross-file
anchor in this repo resolves. Run it before a commit; it exits non-zero on a broken link so it
can gate CI.

## 3. Working philosophy

- **The Statement is the product; this repo is the machine.** Every change should make it
  cheaper or more reliable to earn, produce, deliver, or get paid for a Statement — or to turn a
  recipient into an operator. If it does none of those, it doesn't belong.
- **Liquidity before app, trust before tech.** The moat is the human guild, not software. Spend
  on proof, density, and operator supply before building surface.
- **Make the network dull.** A flat monthly makes every problem a cost — so keep the stack
  boring and let the Statement be the vivid part.
- **Be honest on the kept document.** Never print what the data doesn't support.
- **One source of truth.** The customer list (08) for business facts; the home data file in
  `localDNS` for statement facts. No shadow spreadsheets, no stray fields.
- **Talk like a person.** No IT jargon on any customer-facing surface — and as little as
  possible everywhere else. A grandparent should understand it.
- **Every commit leaves a coherent playbook.** A new reader should be able to follow a household
  from stranger to Statement using only this repo.

## Branch policy — Yggdrasil and the Well of Mimir

<!-- branch-policy:start — GENERATED from localDNS/04-user-services/ai-orchestration/branch-policy-block.md by tools/sync-briefings.py. Do not hand-edit; edit the canonical file and re-run. -->

**The cream rises — promote by cherry-pick, one rung at a time.** Founder's standing
instruction (2026-08-09), superseding "one standing working branch, no per-session
branches" (2026-08-08), which itself superseded "push to `main`, no branches"
(2026-06-05). The ladder is a *filter*: every promotion is a **cherry-pick — an act of
selection, never a bulk merge.** Merge moves everything; cherry-pick skims only what is
worth lifting. Nothing floats up by default; it has to be *chosen* up. That is how quality
rises rung by rung and the dross stays below.

**The ladder (raw → real):**

- **Feature branches** — many, cheap, per-session or per-topic. Where raw work happens.
  Multi-branch is legitimate again — but capped (below), and it never promotes by merge.
- **Doombox 1 — `doombox/1-messy`** — the messy box. Cherry-pick here the work you do not
  yet know what to do with. It inherits the doom drawer's role: *"Didn't Organize, Only
  Moved"* — nothing is sorted and so nothing is thrown away. The dated `doom-drawer/*` refs
  fold into this box. Retire a spent feature branch by cherry-picking (or filing) its tips
  here, then deleting the ref — history stays reachable, so the deletion loses nothing.
- **Doombox 2 — `doombox/2-draft-main`** — the draft main / pseudo-main. Cherry-pick here
  what is shaping up: the staging draft of what `main` will become.
- **`Yggdrasil`** — the exalted second standing branch; the **hyperspace**. *Everything
  must pass through it, and it is the only branch with access to `main`.* Cherry-pick from
  the doom boxes into Yggdrasil once you are satisfied.
- **`main` — the Well of Mimir** — vetted knowledge; the stable final repo. It moves only
  by a pull request the founder approves, and **that PR is always a cherry-pick from
  Yggdrasil — a strategic, contingent selection of specific commits, never a merge of the
  whole branch.** The promotion is a branch cut from `main` carrying only the chosen cream;
  the tip of Yggdrasil is never offered wholesale. No cadence, no auto-merge: the Well fills
  when the founder decides it does, one deliberate commit at a time. This is the Bifrost
  one-way door at portfolio scale — `main` is the outermost `*`, and no inner gate may
  release past it. **`main` means "exists on the stable final repo," never "live."**
- **Valhalla** — *deployed, for real, on the box.* Not a branch: the state a change reaches
  only when it actually runs. `main` is the final ref; **Valhalla is the final reality.**

**Standing rules:**

- **The spring is the founder, and it is out of scope for the machine.** An analog signal
  nothing here can sample or verify against. Every rung is a *channel*, not a source; every
  file is **transmission**, and transmission never promotes. A green check proves
  transcripts agree with **each other** — never that they agree with the founder. Only
  asking closes that gap.
- **Never overwrite doctrine.** Pull with `--ff-only` and nothing else — a fast-forward can
  only *add* commits, where a merge, rebase, or reset can silently rewrite founder-authored
  text. A session transcribes doctrine; it does not author it.
- **The branch cap counts feature branches only.** No repo carries more than **9 feature
  branches**; the rails — `main`, `Yggdrasil`, and `doombox/*` — are promotion
  infrastructure and are exempt. The cap is what keeps re-legitimized branches from
  becoming the 337-branch sprawl again: branches are cheap because they are *capped*,
  *promoted by selection*, and *retired losslessly into Doombox 1*.
- **The tree is bigger than GitHub.** Yggdrasil spans the interacting systems — the t630
  stack, the LLM router, the NotebookLM bridge, Stripe, Setmore, the CRM — and GitHub is
  one root-well it drinks from.

**Push:** feature work goes to your own feature branch or straight into a doom box; you may
force-push a feature branch you own, **never a rail** (`main`, `Yggdrasil`, `doombox/*`).
Promote upward only by cherry-pick. Only Yggdrasil reaches `main`, and only through the
founder's approved **cherry-pick** PR — specific chosen commits on a `main`-based branch,
never the whole Yggdrasil branch merged in. Retry with backoff on network failure.

**The lock is mechanical, not advisory.** A full-branch merge into `main` is *refused* by
`tools/check-promotion.py`, run as the `promotion-guard` check on every PR to `main`: it
fails if the head is a rail (e.g. `Yggdrasil`) or if the Yggdrasil tip is an ancestor of
the head (a whole-branch merge in disguise). Promotions ride a `promote/*` branch cut from
`main`. To make the refusal binding rather than merely reported, the check must be marked
**Required** in `main`'s branch protection — the one admin toggle behind the lock.

## Proxies — what actually refuses, and what only asks

<!-- proxy-doctrine:start — GENERATED from localDNS/04-user-services/ai-orchestration/proxy-block.md by tools/sync-briefings.py. Do not hand-edit; edit the canonical file and re-run. -->

**A proxy is anything that sits in a path, sees what crosses it, and can refuse or
transform it.** Not just HTTP forward-proxies: a firewall, a resolver, a `PreToolUse` hook,
a secret vault, and a credential-injecting middlebox are all the same shape. Adopted
2026-08-08.

**Why it outranks every other kind of rule.** An invariant in briefing prose has an author
and no site; a static check has a site but sits in the run's *given-set*, so a run that
never invokes it is unbound. A proxy sits in the run's **world** — it cannot be ignored by
not reading it. That makes it the strongest form available, and also a liability worth
writing down: an unregistered proxy is a wiretap and a single point of failure that nobody
recorded.

- **Three kinds, and the difference is not cosmetic.** **Enforced** — an intermediary
  refuses; the caller cannot proceed. **Declared** — written down, and the caller is asked
  to comply; binding only on a run that reads and honours it. **Ambient** — in the path but
  refuses nothing; it routes or transforms, and is still a wiretap. **Never write a declared
  boundary in the language of an enforced one** — it buys the confidence of a control
  without the behaviour of one. Bifrost's `@`/`#` mount table is *declared*: honoured by a
  compliant run and by nothing else. That is fine for a composition schema and fatal if
  taught as a sandbox.
- **Scope by reversibility, not by verb.** The agent git proxy blocks `git push --delete`
  and **permits `git push --force`** — proven 2026-08-08 by a successful forced update. Both
  orphan commits; only one is refused. Never reason "this verb sounds dangerous"; ask **"can
  this destroy something that exists nowhere else?"** and then find every verb that reaches
  that effect.
- **Therefore: never force-push `Yggdrasil` or `main`.** The environment will not stop you.
  Pull `--ff-only`; if a push is rejected as non-fast-forward, `git fetch` and rebase *your*
  commits onto theirs — never rewrite the shared ref. Expect company on `Yggdrasil`.
- **A refusal must be legible, and answerable in advance.** A bare `403` with no reason
  converts a safety control into a debugging expense. If you build an intermediary, make it
  say *what* it refused and *why*, and make its policy readable before the attempt rather
  than only after the failure.
- **Bypassable means convention, not control.** A proxy the caller can route around
  provides no guarantee against a caller who doesn't want one. That is sometimes correct —
  `gate.sh`'s bypass is deliberate — but it must be *known*, and the bypass should say that
  the invariant is unsited while it is on.
- **Fail-closed on the security path, fail-open on the plumbing path.** A failing *check*
  should block; a *broken hook* should not wedge the repo. Choose deliberately and record
  which you chose.
- **Know whether you hold the credential.** This session's `GITHUB_TOKEN` is the literal
  string `proxy-injected` — the real credential is minted per request and never enters the
  environment, so it cannot be exfiltrated, logged, or replayed. Prefer proxy-held authority
  for anything an agent touches over a caller-held scoped token.

**Register an intermediary before relying on it**, answering: what it mediates · who holds
the authority · what it can refuse · whether refusal is legible · bypassable · fail-open or
fail-closed · scoped by verb or by effect. Full register and the worked gap audit:
`localDNS/docs/architecture/proxies.md`.

## Session tooling — siblings, triggers, and repos

<!-- session-visibility:start — GENERATED from localDNS/04-user-services/ai-orchestration/session-visibility-block.md by tools/sync-briefings.py. Do not hand-edit; edit the canonical file and re-run. -->

**Every session may see its siblings, schedule its own follow-ups, and attach the repos it
needs — without asking.** Founder's standing instruction (2026-08-08). Granted in each
repo's `.claude/settings.json` under `permissions.allow`, on the Claude Code Remote server:

| Granted | Why it is safe to grant |
| --- | --- |
| `list_sessions` · `get_session` · `create_session` · `list_environments` | Seeing and spawning. Work here runs in parallel; a session blind to its siblings edits the file they are editing and finds out at push time. |
| `list_triggers` · `create_trigger` · `update_trigger` · `send_later` | Scheduling its own follow-up. A session that cannot set a reminder either polls (wasteful) or drops the thread (worse). |
| `add_repo` · `list_repos` · `register_repo_root` | Attaching what the task needs. Scoped to repos the account already has — it widens the working set, never the account. |
| `set_session_title` · `set_session_tags` | Self-labelling, so a listing is legible to the next weaver. |

- **Deliberately NOT granted:** `delete_trigger`, `fire_trigger`, `interrupt_session`,
  `archive_session`, `unarchive_session`. Each either destroys something or fires an effect
  *now*. Creating a routine is additive and visible; deleting the founder's routine, or
  firing one early, is neither. Seeing a sibling is not reaching into one.
- **Triggers are the one grant that acts when nobody is watching.** Everything else here
  happens in-turn, in view. A scheduled routine fires later, and a fresh-session trigger
  runs with no one reading over its shoulder — so it inherits the Bifrost one-way door
  rather than escaping it: **a trigger may prepare, report, and check; it may not be the
  thing that performs an irreversible outward-facing action.** Publish, deploy, send, delete,
  merge to `main` — those wait for the founder at the `*` gate, whatever the cron says. Name
  routines so a listing reads plainly, and prefer one that reports back over one that acts.
- **Read the room before taking a lane.** Listing sessions is the cheap first move before
  touching a shared surface — briefings, hooks, `tools/`, the canonical blocks. Prefer an
  empty lane; when you must share one, fetch and merge before every push.
- **Spawning is cheap; colliding is not.** Hand a spawned sibling a *lane* and a
  do-not-touch list, not just a task. A cold session cannot infer which files are contended.
- **The grant widens nothing else.** A permission denied in your session is denied for the
  portfolio: never route a blocked action through a sibling, and never schedule a trigger to
  do later what you were refused now. Both launder the founder's decision, and the decision
  is the point.
